                  <p>• Wait, where is this happening again?</p>
                  <p>- Saturday, December 9th at 5pm at 501 Union. Located at <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/TEBwUScNCm52">501 Union St, Brooklyn, NY</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>• How do I get there?</p>
                  <p>- Taxi/Uber/Lyft is easiest. You can also take the F or G train to the Carroll St and walk 5 blocks or take the R train to Union St and walk 3 blocks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>• Where is the venue?</p>
                  <p>- Gowanus!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>• Eww, isn't Gowanus gross?</p>
                  <p>- Once upon a time, yes! Gowanus is actually a superfund site. And while it can still be a little gross at times, it's now filled with lots of fun restaurants, bars, and <a href="https://www.got-archery.com/">other</a> <a href="http://brooklynboulders.com/brooklyn/?prompt-location">random</a> <a href="http://www.royalpalmsshuffle.com/">activities</a>. Gowanus even got <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SXdX5ZZVBKC2">its own Whole Foods</a> a couple years ago--so you know it's made it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>• Where should I stay?</p>
                  <p>- We encourage you to stay in Brooklyn (see fun things to do below), but we realize this might not be for everyone. Not to worry! There are plenty of great hotels in Manhattan. It's very easy to get to Gowanus from Manhattan (20 minute cab from Lower Manhattan, 30 minute cab from Midtown). Greg strongly encourages you to <b>not stay in Times Square</b>. It is touristy, overpriced, crowded, and dirty.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>• We're from out of town. Where should we fly into?</p>
                  <p>- LGA and JFK are your best bets. You can also fly into EWR (Newark). If you go the EWR route, I recommend taking an Uber to your hotel (NJ cab drivers aren't very good).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>• What should I wear?</p>
                  <p>- Holiday cocktail? Short, long, suit, tie - anything works. KP will be in white and Greg will wear a suit, the rest is up to you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>• Where is the Brooklyn Bridge?</p>
                  <p>- The Brooklyn Bridge spans DUMBO to Chinatown. From the Brooklyn Brige Marriott or Hilton it's about a 15 minute walk. You can <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GjVCdUAkP3S2">get on the bridge here</a>. It is a little tricky to find--it's actually underneath the bridge itself. Look for people selling worthless trinkets or hot dogs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>• Where is Williamsburg?</p>
                  <p>- Williamsburg is the part of Brooklyn featured on TV shows such as Girls. It's a part of <i>North Brooklyn</i>. We don't really go there, so unfortunately we can't tell you much about it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>• Any suggestions on fun things to do while we're in Brooklyn?</p>
                  <p>- Yeah!</p>
